It's running a handful of VMs on Proxmox. Most of them I can get rid of by moving their services to Kubernetes, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my NAS VM and Plex server. The latter you can easily run in Kubernetes but I'm not planning on having particularly powerful nodes and I need transcoding.&lt;/p&gt;
