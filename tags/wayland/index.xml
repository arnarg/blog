This is the setup I run on my workstation where I have a 60% keyboard on which I use caps lock as a function key for a second layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because muscle memory is a thing I have been using Karabiner Elements to remap the keyboard on my work macbook pro but I could not find a suitable alternative for Linux when using a Wayland compositor.&lt;/p&gt;
